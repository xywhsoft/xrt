# Service extensions progress

Target and rules: [development contract](service-extensions-plan.md).

## Current state

- All four final products are in development, not production accepted.
- P0 source/worktree isolation and execution contract are established.
- xredis binary-safe command encoding and the bounded RESP2/3 event reader are
  locally verified. Runtime requests and owned reply objects remain pending.
- P1 continues with independently testable Cron and RPC/MQTT protocol leaves.
- Primary checkout changes remain outside this branch.

## Baseline checks

Source: `1d4109aff9d52d0452742669e81caa8bef626922`.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python tools/check_release_maturity.py` | Existing failure: missing `net_file_future` single-test closure coverage |
| `python tools/generate_features.py --check` | Passed |
| Core single headers | Initially stale; synchronized from tracked inputs in `32abef18` |
| `python tools/generate_example_index.py --check` | Existing layout mismatch: the committed `examples/hash/crc32.c` is not a `main.c` entry; the primary checkout already has an unrelated staged rename, which this branch preserves |

## Command encoder validation

- `python -m unittest tools.test_api_docs tools.test_api_reference tools.test_extension_layout`: 15 passed.
- `python tools/build.py --compiler gcc --manifest extlibs/xredis/config/modules.json --suite xredis_tests`: Windows modular and single tests passed.
- `python tools/build.py --compiler gcc --arch x64 --manifest extlibs/xredis/config/modules.json --suite xredis_command --no-single --cflag=-O2`: Windows test and offline example passed.
- `python tools/build.py --compiler gcc --arch x64 --manifest extlibs/xredis/config/modules.json --suite xredis --trim-only`: Windows and Ubuntu/WSL product/leaf probes passed, including required-dependency rejection.
- Ubuntu/WSL `xredis_tests` with `-O2 -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer`: modular and single passed.
- `python tools/package.py --manifest extlibs/xredis/config/modules.json --suite xredis --kind static/shared --verify`: independent consumers passed on Windows and Ubuntu/WSL.
- Asset maturity, generated API coverage and reference consistency passed; strict release correctly rejects the developing product root.
- Performance workload smoke passed separately on Windows and Ubuntu/WSL, one sample each. This is not a pinned baseline or external-client comparison.

Raw ignored logs/reports: `out/service-extensions/evidence/`. See
[the feature matrix](../../extlibs/xredis/docs/coverage.md). The dedicated
workflow checks the current real module; actual GitHub Actions execution is
not claimed by local YAML validation.

## Incremental reader validation

- Independent RESP2/3 grammar and explicit depth stack: all scalar/aggregate
  types, binary strings/errors/verbatim, attributes, top-level pushes, streamed
  bulk/array/map/set, checked signed integers and locale-independent numeric text.
- Canonical expected event trees pass every two-part split and bytewise feeds;
  one/two/three-byte budgets, pause after every event and empty resumes preserve
  exact event delivery and pipeline boundaries.
- 10,000 independently encoded binary-array properties and 20,000 deterministic
  raw/mutated inputs pass; whole and bytewise/paused mutation results agree on
  terminal error, detection offset, consumed stream bytes and frame count.
- All configured byte/depth/item/value limits, malformed wire, every truncated
  prefix, orphan attributes, callback failure/reentry, invalid spans/aliasing,
  creation/diagnostic OOM and repeated create/destroy ownership quotas pass.
- 10,000 warm Feed/Finish/Info/Reset operations leave allocation counters and the
  ambient error unchanged. Create performs one bounded XRT allocation; callbacks
  and any later owned reply builder have their own costs.
- Windows GCC 16.2 O2 modular/single tests and both offline examples passed;
  product/leaf trim probes and independent static/DLL consumers passed.
- Ubuntu/WSL GCC O2 ASan+UBSan modular and reader single tests passed. O2 examples,
  trim probes and independent static/shared consumers passed. The single test
  also passed a direct compile of the already-current generated headers while
  the normal generator's cross-filesystem scan was slow; the normal build then
  completed successfully as well.
- API/docs/asset maturity and generated-input consistency pass. The 15 related
  Python tooling tests pass. CI now runs all implemented xredis examples.
- Reader workload smoke passed on both systems with a data-dependent checksum,
  one sample each. This is not a pinned performance baseline, an owned-tree
  benchmark, native Linux acceptance or external-client comparison.

Reproducible commands use `xredis_tests --cflag=-O2`, reader single selector
`--single-test test_single_xredis_reader`, Linux sanitizer flags
`--cflag=-fsanitize=address,undefined --cflag=-fno-omit-frame-pointer
--ldflag=-fsanitize=address,undefined`, product `--suite xredis` example/trim/
package consumers, and performance `--profiles xredis_reader --smoke --repeats 1`.
Raw `reader-*` logs and the unpinned smoke JSON reports remain under the ignored
`out/service-extensions/` evidence paths. Reader contracts and the full matrix
are in [reader.md](../../extlibs/xredis/docs/reader.md).
