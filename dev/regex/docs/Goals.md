# Goals

bbre's list of design goals (in rough order of priority) are:

<ol start="0">
<li>

*Correctness*: In this case, correctness means behaving exactly as the library is specced to behave. For bbre, this means adhering to the [Syntax](Syntax.md) and [API](API.md) descriptions, which are both in turn grounded in the conventions laid out by other regex libraries. This is #0 because it's not exactly a goal since it's so obvious. Any regex library worth its salt should strive to be correct and predictable in its usage.

</li>
<li>

*Safety*: Being written in C, bbre is prone to the usual classes of safety bugs that C programs are subject to. However, we should try as hard as possible, through aggressive testing/fuzzing, to expose and correct safety issues. Additionally, the API and design of the code should minimize the potential for safety issues. See [Testing](Testing.md) for more philosophy about this. Part of being safe is providing complexity guarantees too: untrusted inputs to bbre only influence linear or logarithmic algorithms, with the exception of character class compilation, which is quadratic but explicitly and conservatively bounded.

</li>
<li>

*Simplicity*: This goes hand in hand with Safety and many of the other points in this list. In C, more so than other languages, simplicity is a virtue: at least for me, the more C code I have, the worse my C code is. Cutting down on code makes it accessible to other developers, and makes it more auditable/hackable.

</li>
<li>

*Ease of Use/Portability*: C libraries (especially those with complicated build processes or lots of translation units) can be hard to integrate into larger projects. bbre expressly chooses a conservative C standard and zero dependencies (beyond a few freestanding functions in libc like `memcpy` and `strlen`) in order to facilitate easy usage. Also, bbre will always be distributed as a single .c/.h pair.

</li>
<li>

*Speed*: Finally, the library should be reasonably fast, without sacrificing the above goals in an unreasonable way. This sounds like a canned lawyer response, but I'm just trying to be nuanced, speed (especially in C) is typically about tradeoffs.

</li>
</ol>
